About Mission to Mars

Summary -
Mission to Mars for React is the first part of a two part SPA project for RED Academy. The goal of the React Mission to Mars project was to learn about how to build react components and a fully functioning React app. In this app, a user can begin a simple three part evaluation to see if they qualify to go to Mars. The user must answer all three questions to be accepted.

Experience from the project:
React functions on a very specific logic, one that doesn't allow for much wiggle room. Once I solidified my understanding of State, props and the cyclical nature of the React render process, I felt very comfortable in the framework. React offers developers a way to build fully functioning apps with relative ease, at a granular level. I can easily see working in React as a full time developer.
Some big take aways from this project is how I can import and export already built applications, much like a javascript library, but with a lot more functionality and control. A prime example of this is the Timer/countdown clock feature of the app. If I ever to display a countdown timer in a future react project, I don't have to build it, but instead import the timer from this project and alter it slightly to meet the project's need.
Some difficult aspects of React included the very limited way that React handles logic and how quickly it is changing.
